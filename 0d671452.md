My brother gifted this book to us as he knows we are avid hikers.  This
fascinating read explores a universal question that most hikers arrive at after
spending enough time outdoors: how and why do trails form?  It also touches on
the subject of trail quality, looking at the history of human and animal trails 
and analyzing the choices made in their development.  I found this particular
topic quite captivating, given my time spent outdoors in the winter where I've
been faced with blank canvases of snow and the decision on how to form my own
trail.

While the book's story begins with an exploration of concrete, physical trails
used by humans and animals, Moor consistently weaves in complex, philosophical
discussions of how trails relate to the human experience, particularly as the
discussion of trails moves towards more abstract concepts such as information
trails.

This is a highly recommended read for anyone has spent time exploring outdoor
trails.
