> Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each
> year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency
> land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and
> 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few
> new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are
> optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change. We live with a
> deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this
> terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres — an
> area about the size of Maine — to restabilize in terms of fire.

> As Ingalsbee said, “You won’t find any climate deniers on the fire line.”
