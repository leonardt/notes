# What Time Feels Like When You’re Improvising -- Heather Berlin -- Nautilus
## The neurology of flow states

> Time may be a property of physics, but it is also a property of the mind,
> which ultimately makes it a product of the brain.

> Your sense of time is malleable and subjective—it changes in response to
> changing contexts and input, and it can be distorted when the brain is
> damaged, or affected by drugs, disease, sleep deprivation, or naturally
> altered states of consciousness.

> During what psychologists call “flow states,” where one is completely
> immersed and absorbed in a mental or physical act, people often report an
> altered sense of time, place, and self.

> Improvisation appears to take place in an altered state of mind.

> During musical improvisation, in jazz or freestyle rap, studies show a
> distinctive increase in medial prefrontal cortex activation. The medial
> prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a brain area known to be involved in intentional,
> internally generated self-expression and the pursuit of goal-oriented
> behaviors. This makes sense, since improvised performance requires you to
> come up with new material in a rapid stream, and deploy it just as quickly
> for a listening or watching audience. The other aspect to this pattern is a
> decrease in lateral orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
> activation (DLPFC). The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral
> prefrontal cortex are brain areas involved in conscious self-monitoring,
> effortful problem solving, focused attention, and evaluation and regulation
> of goal-directed or planned behaviors. These lateral areas assess whether
> behaviors conform to social norms, and exert inhibitory control over
> inappropriate or maladaptive behavior. But as any skilled performer will tell
> you, inhibitions are the enemy of improvisation.
