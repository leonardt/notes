  - General methodology for mapping high-level computations into hardware structures
    - Data flows from memory in a rhythmic fashion, passing through many
      processing elements before returning to memory.
    - Can be two dimensional (rectangular, triangular, hexagonal) to make use
      of higher degrees of parallelism
    - Data flow may be at multiple speeds in multiple directions -- both inputs
      and (partial) results flow (in classical pipelined systems, only results
      flow)
    - Regularity and reconfigurability arise from modularity
  - Simple and regular design
    - Special-purpose systems must be cost effective (to justify their limited
      applicability)
    - Costs = nonrecurring (design) and recurring (parts).  Parts are cheap for
      both special purpose and general purpose systems, so its the design cost
      that must be small to make a special purpose system attractive
    - Design cost can be avoided by using an appropriate architecture:
      decompose into a few types of simple building blocks which are used
      repetitively with simple interfaces. 
    - Simple, regular designs are likely to be modular (can be adjusted for
      various performance/cost goals, i.e. cost can be made proportional to
      performance required)
  - Concurrency and communication
    - Diminishing growth rate for component speed, need to make use of
      concurrent processing elements to continue to improve speed.
    - An increased number of processing elements working simultaneously
      requires significant amounts of coordination and communication.
    - Goal: algorithms that support high concurrency while employing simple,
      regular communication and control.
