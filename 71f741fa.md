  - General methodology for mapping high-level computations into hardware structures
    - Data flows from memory in a rhythmic fashion, passing through many
      processing elements before returning to memory.
    - Can be two dimensional (rectangular, triangular, hexagonal) to make use
      of higher degrees of parallelism
    - Data flow may be at multiple speeds in multiple directions -- both inputs
      and (partial) results flow (in classical pipelined systems, only results
      flow)
    - Regularity and reconfigurability arise from modularity
